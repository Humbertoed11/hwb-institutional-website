# Act V: The Living Chronicles
## *Continuous, Date-Stamped Operational Ledger*

---

### Purpose of the Living Chronicles
This document serves as the permanent, date-stamped historical log of the ongoing evolution of SigmaAcademy™. Every time an architectural decision is made, a new training course is authored, a client pilot is launched, or revenue milestones are achieved, an entry is recorded here and automatically synchronized into the PostgreSQL neural database (`sigma_kb`).

### Chronicle Entries

#### Entry 001: The Inception of SigmaAcademy™
- **Timestamp:** 2026-09-19T20:30:00-05:00
- **Executive Authority:** Humberto Dominguez, CEO
- **Systems Architect:** George (mbB, Senior Software Engineer)
- **Context:** During review of the Collin College Frisco Campus RFP requirements (T&C § 134–144), CEO Humberto Dominguez directed the creation of `TRN-SAF-01` (Safe Work Habits & Ergonomic Injury Prevention) and approved the strategic initiative to store training centrally for multi-project reuse and commercialization.
- **Milestone Achieved:** Applied Migration 008 to PostgreSQL, creating `AcademyTenants`, `AcademyCourses`, `AcademyCourseModules`, `AcademyQuizQuestions`, and `AcademyEnrollments`. Authored 6 interactive modules and a 5-question comprehension quiz for `TRN-SAF-01`.

#### Entry 002: Role-Based Curriculum Packages & Magic Token Dispatch
- **Timestamp:** 2026-09-19T21:15:00-05:00
- **Context:** CEO Humberto Dominguez approved the workflow to assign bundled certifications directly to vetted candidates.
- **Milestone Achieved:** Applied Migration 009 to PostgreSQL, establishing `AcademyPackages` and `AcademyPackageCourses`. Seeded six standardized packages (`PKG-CORE-W2`, `PKG-COLLIN-CAMPUS`, `PKG-COLLIN-LEAD`, `PKG-DAYCARE-SAFE`, `PKG-1099-FASTPASS`, `PKG-CONSTR-FINAL`). Engineered single-use magic tokens (`tok_...`) enabling frictionless passwordless training on smartphones.

#### Entry 003: Backoffice Workforce Operations Integration
- **Timestamp:** 2026-09-19T21:35:00-05:00
- **Context:** Connecting the training assignment engine directly into the daily operational backoffice.
- **Milestone Achieved:** Added "Assign Training Package" action triggers to the W-2 Employee and 1099 Subcontractor tables in `backoffice_operations.html`. Built the modal with instant magic-link copy functionality and dynamic status reporting. Verified end-to-end assignment, mobile completion, score recording, and public QR verification generation (`cert-3657197805cb`).

#### Entry 004: The Master Chronicle Book & Neural Database Ingestion
- **Timestamp:** 2026-09-19T22:30:00-05:00
- **Context:** CEO Humberto Dominguez directed the formal documentation of the entire concept and origin story into a permanent book, with full integration into the institutional neural database (`sigma_kb`) and the Master Manual Index.
- **Milestone Achieved:** Authored *From Mops to Machines: The Creation of SigmaAcademy™* (`HWB-ACADEMY-BOOK-001`). Generated official QMS HTML edition (`hwb-qms-book-01_from_mops_to_machines_the_creation_of_sigma_academy.html`). Registered in `qms_index.json` under Operations & Training. Updated `scripts/sigma_sync.py` to continuously index all book chapters into `sigma_kb`.
